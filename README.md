The team was tasked to develop Escape Room game elements within a budget of $1000. Within the 13 weeks of DIP, the team has successfully completed our escape room implementation and the selected theme of the Escape Room is that of Space, which involves four games. Each game is interrelated and provides RFID tags for the final game. An overview of the Escape Room flow is shown below. As the team had seven members, we split the team to work on different games at the same time for maximum efficiency. The table below illustrates the summary of the distribution of work. Through 13 weeks of troubleshooting, the team has managed to complete and implement a successful program that fulfills all our main objectives.

Game 1
Cosmic Command Center

Game 2
Galactic Code Breaker

Game 3
Planetary Positioning System

Game 4
